### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sander van Rijn. Iâ€™m a Research Software Engineer at the Netherlands eScience Center currently working on Energy System Modelling. My background is in Natural Computing Algorithms and Machine Learning, and I'm generally interested in Clean Code and Open Science practices.

You can find my homepage at [svrijn.nl](https://www.svrijn.nl), although if you're looking for anything other than my publications, my [blog](https://blog.svrijn.nl) is probably what you're looking for.

## Repositories

Out of the various repositories I have here on GitHub, I have pinned the ones you might be most interested in. By all means have a look around them and get in touch if they were helpful or if you have any questions about them.
