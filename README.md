### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sander van Rijn. Iâ€™m a Computer Science PhD candidate at Leiden University with interests in Natural Computing Algorithms, Machine Learning, Clean Code and Open Science practices.

You can find my homepage at [svrijn.nl](https://www.svrijn.nl), although if you're looking for anything other than my publications, my [blog](https://blog.svrijn.nl) is probably what you're looking for.

## Repositories

Out of the various repositories I have here on GitHub, I have pinned the ones you might be most interested in. By all means have a look around them and get in touch if they were helpful or if you have any questions about them.
